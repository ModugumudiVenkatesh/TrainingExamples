                Based on the provided table schemas, here is the SQL query to solve the problem.
                The query works by:
                * Creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) named BankTrans to identify all customers and the dates they made a bank transaction. It considers both the sender and receiver of the bank transaction.
                * Creating a second CTE named CryptoTrans to identify all customers and the dates they made a crypto transaction. This requires joining through several tables to link a transaction back to a customer's bank account ID.
                * Joining the two CTEs on both the CustomerID and the TransactionDate to find the overlaps.
                * Finally, counting the number of unique customers from the resulting joined set.
